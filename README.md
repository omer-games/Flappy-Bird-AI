# Flappy Bird AI

Flappy Bird AI is a Python program that utilizes the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) library to teach an artificial neural network to play the classic Flappy Bird game autonomously.

## Credit for Original Game

This program is built upon a Python Flappy Bird game created by Leonardo Marques.

## How it Works

The program uses NEAT to evolve a population of neural networks. Each neural network controls the movements of a bird in the Flappy Bird game. Over generations, the neural networks evolve to improve their ability to navigate through pipes and achieve higher scores.

## Features

- NEAT algorithm for evolving neural networks.
- Autonomous playing of the Flappy Bird game.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/omer-games/Flappy-Bird-AI.git
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Program:**

    ```bash
    python flappy_bird_ai.py
    ```

4. Watch as the neural networks learn to play Flappy Bird autonomously.

## Configuration

You can adjust the NEAT configuration parameters in the `config.txt` file to experiment with different evolutionary settings.

## Note

Flappy Bird AI is designed as an educational project to demonstrate the application of NEAT in evolving artificial intelligence for game playing. If you have suggestions or encounter any issues, feel free to open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/your-username/FlappyBirdAI).
